A (partially complete) Org Mode parser in Clojure.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/clj-org/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/clj-org)

This library parses (a subset of) Emacs [Org
Mode](http://orgmode.org/) format to
[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup), which is a
representation of HTML in S-expressions common for rendering Web pages
but can be used more generally, as desired.

## Implementation

Factored out of the [blorg](https://github.com/eigenhombre/blorg) blog
prototype, this parser started out as an Instaparse grammar.  However,
it proved too difficult to get good performance without ambiguities,
so the parser has become what is basically a series of monster regular
expressions [example here](https://github.com/eigenhombre/clj-org/blob/master/src/clj_org/org.clj#L361).

## Example

    (ns myproject.core
      (:require [clj-org.org :refer [txt->org]]))
    (txt->org "#+TITLE: This is an Org Mode file.

    * This is the outer section
    ** This is an inner section
    Inner section body -- /with italic text/!  And *bold text* too.

    - Plain List Item 1
    - Plain List Item 2
    [[http://eigenhombre.com][A link to a Web site]]
    ")
    ;;=>
    {:title "This is an Org Mode file.",
     :headers "\n#+TITLE: This is an Org Mode file.\n\n",
     :content
     [:div
      [:h1 [:p "This is the outer section"]]
      [:h2 [:p "This is an inner section"]]
      [:span
       [:p
	[:span
	 [:span
	  "Inner section body &#x2013; "
	  [:em "with italic text"]
	  "!  And "]
	 [:strong "bold text"]
	 " too.\n"]]
       [:ul
	[:li [:p "Plain List Item 1\n"]]
	[:li [:p "Plain List Item 2\n"]]]
       [:p
	[:span
	 [:a {:href "http://eigenhombre.com"} "A link to a Web site"]
	 "\n"]]]]}
